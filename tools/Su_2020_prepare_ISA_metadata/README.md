# Prepare ISA metadata for Su et al. 2020

This repository is made for the generation of ISA files for a multi-omics study of Covid-19 patients [Su et al. 2020][Su2020].

## Docker environment (**Important**)

In order to run the Jupyter Notebook in this repo, a specific set of dependencies needs to be installed. For this purpose, we create a [Dockernized environment](https://github.com/Xomics/Isatools_environment), containing all packages (isa-api and more) that are necessary to run this Jupyter notebook.
