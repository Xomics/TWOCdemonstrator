# Create Phenopackets for TWOC demonstrator

Phenotype data from Su et al. (2020) is located at [data/TWOC-MultiOmics-Studies-COVID_300Samples.xlsx](data/TWOC-MultiOmics-Studies-COVID_300Samples.xlsx) and used as input for the Jupyter notebook [notebooks/create_phenopackets.ipynb](notebooks/create_phenopackets.ipynb). The notebook converts each row to a Phenopackets Individual.

The conda environment can be created from [environment.yml](environment.yml).
